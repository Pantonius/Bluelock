# Bluelock
Bluelock is a little bash script that uses the quality of a bluetooth connection to lock your computer screen if you leave you workspace with a predefined bluetooth device.

## Usage
Bluelock helps you to find your bluetooth device and establish a connection if you just run it without any arguments
```./bluelock.sh```

You may define the bluetooth address and rssi threshold as follows
```./bluelock.sh <bluetooth address> <rssi threshold>```
